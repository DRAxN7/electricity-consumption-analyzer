# Electricity Consumption Analyzer (Python)

## Overview
The Electricity Consumption Analyzer is a Python-based data analysis project that processes electricity usage data to compute key performance metrics and visualize consumption patterns.

It demonstrates practical skills in data handling, analysis, and visualization using real-world–style utility data.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze electricity consumption data from a CSV file  
- Calculate important energy metrics  
- Visualize daily consumption trends  
- Derive basic insights from historical data  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas – data loading and analysis  
- Matplotlib – data visualization  

---

## Features
- Reads electricity consumption data from a CSV file  
- Calculates:
  - Total energy consumption  
  - Average daily consumption  
  - Peak consumption  
  - Load factor  
- Visualizes data using:
  - Line chart (trend analysis)  
  - Bar chart (day-wise comparison)  

---

## Sample Insights
- Identified peak electricity consumption days from daily usage data  
- Observed variations in daily energy usage through trend analysis  
- Evaluated how evenly electricity was consumed using load factor  

---

## Future Improvements
- Add hourly or 15-minute demand data (kW analysis)  
- Include electricity billing estimation  
- Export results to reports (CSV / PDF)
